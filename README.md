## **Context**

I've always faced the challenge of searching far and wide for web app resources, only to forget their names later. Web Dev Tools is a simple app that compiles some incredibly useful and user-friendly tools I've come across. I've personally tested the majority of the applications listed here, and for the ones I haven't, I've thoroughly researched them and found them to be quite impressive.

## **What I learned**

- Tailwind is great but it's creating a dependency
- Love DaisyUI but maybe I have to look in other directions
- Redux is hard, and more when used in NgRx
- Astro is so fun and intuitive, looking forward to using it more
- Angular is great for SPAs, sadly it's not that good with SSR or SSG
- Gotta try Standalone componentes
- Gotta optimize more my data flow, avoiding innecesary fetching
- UI design is HAAAAAAAARD, it was the most time consuming thing in the development of this project
- Gotta use UI libraries that will allow me to code faster even tho the design could be more generic
- Gotta define very well my data models from the beginning
- Do I wanna become a firebase expert or should I look other options?
- I wish I knew backend, but it is really time consuming
