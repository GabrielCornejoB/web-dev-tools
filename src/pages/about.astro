    <p>
      Hey there! I've always faced the challenge of searching far and wide for
      web app resources, only to forget their names later. Web Dev Tools is a
      simple app that compiles some incredibly useful and user-friendly tools
      I've come across. I've personally tested the majority of the applications
      listed here, and for the ones I haven't, I've thoroughly researched them
      and found them to be quite impressive.<br /><br />
       Just to clarify, I'm not the owner of any of the resources featured on
      this page, and I'm not profiting from this applicationâ€”it's purely for fun
      and convenience. Furthermore, all the resources are provided for free,
      with most of them not requiring any login. However, please note that a few
      may require attribution if used for commercial purposes. Therefore, it's
      always a good practice to double-check the licensing requirements before
      using any resource.<br /><br />
       I sincerely hope you find our site valuable and that it aids you, even if
      just a little, on your web development journey!

      Previously I said to you that you should double check if any resource
      needs any sort of attibution, some of these tools doesn't even need but I
      wanted to list them here:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>- FontAwesome - For all of the icons used in this application</li>
      <li>
        - DaisyUI - Didn't used it much for the final product but really useful
        in the first designs
      </li>
      <li>
        - Dylan Brouwer - This page design is heavily inspired in his portfolio
      </li>
      <li>- ChatGPT - Wrote most of the descriptions haha</li>
    </ul>
